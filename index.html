              <p>This is the final article in my annual review of all things ed-tech. (Good riddance.) As the title suggests, it examines the money flooding into the sector: venture capital investment, venture philanthropy, and the like. A look at which startups got bought, which went down in flames, which get hyped and why....</p>

              <p>One of my most popular (and most controversial) blog posts. Despite all the hype and all the investment, I remain skeptical that Codecademy can actually do much other than get people to tweet that they've signed up to learn to code. Building from there with meaningless blackjack exercises? Yeah. Nope....</p>

              <p>The most popular post ever on Hack Education. Here I describe why some educators question Khan Academy and challenge the media hype that Sal Khan is "math's messiah."
