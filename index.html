              <p>The most popular post ever on Hack Education. Here I describe why some educators question Khan Academy and challenge the media hype that Sal Khan is "math's messiah."

              <p>For the past several years, I've picked a list of the Top 10 Ed-Tech Startups of the year. Every year, the task gets harder and harder. Most ed-tech startups just aren't "the top." This year, I have picked two.(But I've offered other metrics for "the top" too.)...</p>

              <p>What were the top education technology startups of 2013? Spoiler alert: I wasn't able to choose 10. I chose 3, two of which I've featured in previous years and one of which isn't a startup at all. Not sure why I still write this year-end story anymore. Too hard....</p>
