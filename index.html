              <p>This is the tenth (and final) post in my annual review of all things ed-tech. This one examines the myriad of ways that education technology exacerbates inequality -- socio-economic inequalities, information inequalities, political inequalities. I realize that many people believe ed-tech is necessarily progressive. I hope we realize soon that it is not....</p>

            <section class="post-excerpt" itemprop="description">
              <p>A brief history of the Speak & Spell, one of the most iconic pieces of education technology. First introduced at the Consumer Electronics Show in 1978, the Speak & Spell is a teaching machine in the behaviorist sense. Texas Instruments' development of the device involved an important technological breakthrough in speech technology....</p>

              <p>"Disruptive innovation" is millennialist. It is apocalyptic. It is End Times. It is a story of doom and salvation. It is capitalism's great myth. I don't mean "myth" as in "lie." I mean "myth" as in "the most sacred story you tell," the one you'd never dare challenge or question....</p>

              <p>One of my most popular (and most controversial) blog posts. Despite all the hype and all the investment, I remain skeptical that Codecademy can actually do much other than get people to tweet that they've signed up to learn to code. Building from there with meaningless blackjack exercises? Yeah. Nope....</p>

              <p>The most popular post ever on Hack Education. Here I describe why some educators question Khan Academy and challenge the media hype that Sal Khan is "math's messiah."
