              <p>When I talk to ed-tech entrepreneurs, I meet them with high expectations, lots of support, and loads of skepticism. I'm keen to hear about their products, but I also want to know more about their educational philosophies and their vision for the future of education. This is a test....</p>

              <p>That one time at an Apple press event... I'll never be invited back after this screed. But I was so disappointed in what Apple unveiled at its first post-Steve Jobs event.

              <p>One of my most popular (and most controversial) blog posts. Despite all the hype and all the investment, I remain skeptical that Codecademy can actually do much other than get people to tweet that they've signed up to learn to code. Building from there with meaningless blackjack exercises? Yeah. Nope....</p>
